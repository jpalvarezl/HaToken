Using his knowledge of Chinese herbs and medicine, he mixed Chinese medicinal herbs that heat up bodies with lamb and chili in doughs, folded the doughs into the shape of ears, put them in boiling water, and gave them to the poor people. After eating the wrapped dough with herbs and drinking the soup, people's frostbite heals quickly.[14] In memory of his help to many people, eating Jiaozi became a tradition during the winter.[15][16] Written records show that jiaozi became popular during the Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 CE) in China, and the earliest unearthed real jiaozi were found in Astana Cemetery dated between 499 CE and 640 CE.[17][18]",

Extended family members may gather together to make jiaozi, and they are also eaten at farewells to family members or friends. On the night of Chinese New Year's Eve, jiaozi are usually served at the stroke of midnight after a big dinner.[19] This is because the term \"jiaozi\" sounds similar to an old Chinese saying that means \"stepping into a new era\", and this is applied to the New Year.[20] Some people will place a coin or candy inside the dumpling in the hope of obtaining a fortune or having a sweet life.[13][21] Chinese people also eat Jiaozi on the 5th day after the Chinese New Year in the lunar calendar. According to Chinese tradition, many things are forbidden during these first five days,[22] so people eat jiaozi on the 5th day to celebrate the end of this period.[23] On the first day of the hottest days of summer, jiaozi mark the beginning of the harvest, where the harvested wheat is made into foods like jiaozi to celebrate the success of future harvesting.[24]",
