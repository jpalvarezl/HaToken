The term emerged in English by the 17th century, where it referred to a small lump of dough cooked by simmering or steaming.The definition has since grown to include filled dumplings, where the dough encloses a sweet or savory filling. Dumplings can be cooked in a variety of ways, including boiling, simmering, and steaming, and occasionally baking or frying; however, some definitions rule out baking and frying in order to exclude items like fritters and other pastries that are generally not regarded as dumplings by most individuals.",

The flour clings to the milk and forms dumplings, which are then boiled in a mixture of milk and butter. They are served hot and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Dombolo, also called ujeqe or steam bread, is made from steamed dough and is often consumed with different kinds of side dishes such as chicken stew, beef stew, oxtail stew, lamb stew, or tripe.",

These foods are often served with a variety of dishes like ackee and saltfish, kidneys, liver, salt mackerel, etc., and often taste better when refried. A refried dumpling is an already-boiled dumpling left over from previous cooking that is then fried to give it a slightly crispy outer layer and a tender middle. A purely fried white flour dumpling (also known as a \"Johnny Cake\") is golden brown and looks similar to a bu\u00f1uelo; these can often substitute for boiled dumplings, but they are mostly consumed as part of breakfast. Fried dumplings can be made with or without sugar. One popular variation is the Jamaican Festival, a cylindrical fried dumpling made with flour, sugar, cornmeal, and baking powder. These slightly sweet dumplings are served with all types of traditional Jamaican home food, particularly as a complement to the sweet-and-sour escovitched fish, as well as street food.",

The stuffing usually consists of saut\u00e9ed meat (e.g. beef, pork, or chicken), onions, and garlic. They are all seasoned with cumin, aji sauce, raisins, peanuts, olives, and sliced or chopped hard-boiled eggs. After stuffing, a ball is formed, rolled in flour, and deep-fried in hot oil. The stuffed potatoes are usually accompanied by a sauce consisting of sliced onions, lime juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and slices of fresh peppers. The same dish may also be made with seafood. In some countries, yuca pur\u00e9e is used as the starch component.",

The dumplings are formed into small balls and are first cooked in olive oil before boiling. Once the dumplings are crispy on the outside, they are then boiled with added ingredients.",

Made of unleavened dough squares filled with meat, it is similar to the Russian pelmeni and the Chinese wonton, but in observance of the Islamic dietary rules, the meat filling is without pork. Chuchvara can be served in a clear soup or on their own, with vinegar or sauce based on finely chopped greens, tomatoes and hot peppers. Another popular way of serving chuchvara is topped with suzma (strained qatiq) or with smetana (sour cream), Russian-style.",

The shape is likened to that of a human ear. The skin can be either thin and elastic or thicker, and it is sometimes said that the skin of a dumpling determines its quality.[13] Popular meat fillings include ground meat (usually pork, but sometimes beef or chicken), shrimp, and even fish. Popular mixtures include pork with Chinese cabbage, pork with garlic chives, pork and shrimp with vegetables, pork with spring onion, and garlic chives with scrambled eggs. Filling mixtures will vary depending on personal tastes, region, and season. According to region and season, ingredients can include oyster.[13] Jiaozi are usually boiled, steamed, or fried, and they continue to be a traditional dish. In Northern China, dumplings are commonly eaten with a dipping sauce made of vinegar and chilli oil or paste, and occasionally with some soy sauce added in.",

        "text": "According to legends, jiaozi were invented in the Eastern Han Dynasty between 150\u2013219 CE by Zhang Zhongjing, who was a popular Chinese medicine practitioner. When Zhang returned to his hometown during a harsh winter, he saw many poor people suffering from frostbite in their ears due to the bad governing of the emperor. Using his knowledge of Chinese herbs and medicine, he mixed Chinese medicinal herbs that heat up bodies with lamb and chili in doughs, folded the doughs into the shape of ears, put them in boiling water, and gave them to the poor people. After eating the wrapped dough with herbs and drinking the soup, people's frostbite heals quickly.[14] In memory of his help to many people, eating Jiaozi became a tradition during the winter.[15][16] Written records show that jiaozi became popular during the Southern and Northern dynasties (420\u2013589 CE) in China, and the earliest unearthed real jiaozi were found in Astana Cemetery dated between 499 CE and 640 CE.[17][18]",

Extended family members may gather together to make jiaozi, and they are also eaten at farewells to family members or friends. On the night of Chinese New Year's Eve, jiaozi are usually served at the stroke of midnight after a big dinner.[19] This is because the term \"jiaozi\" sounds similar to an old Chinese saying that means \"stepping into a new era\", and this is applied to the New Year.[20] Some people will place a coin or candy inside the dumpling in the hope of obtaining a fortune or having a sweet life.[13][21] Chinese people also eat Jiaozi on the 5th day after the Chinese New Year in the lunar calendar. According to Chinese tradition, many things are forbidden during these first five days,[22] so people eat jiaozi on the 5th day to celebrate the end of this period.[23] On the first day of the hottest days of summer, jiaozi mark the beginning of the harvest, where the harvested wheat is made into foods like jiaozi to celebrate the success of future harvesting.[24]",

The first dumplings in Korea are seen in the Hyowooyeoljeon (\ud6a8\uc6b0\uc5f4\uc804/\u5b5d\u53cb\u5217\u50b3) in Goryeosa (\uace0\ub824\uc0ac, \u9ad8\u9e97\u53f2), and it is said that they were made by a naturalized Khitan during the reign of King Myeongjong of Goryeo. They are typically filled with a mixture of ingredients, including ground pork, kimchi, galbi, bulgogi, vegetables, or cellophane noodles, but there are many variations. Mandu can be steamed, fried, or boiled. The dumplings can also be used to make a soup called mandu-guk (\ub9cc\ub463\uad6d).",

A dumpling is called Klo\u00df in northern Germany, Kn\u00f6del, Nockerl or Kn\u00f6pfle in southern Germany and Austria, and pierogi in Poland. These are flour dumplings, the most common dumplings, thin or thick, made with eggs and semolina flour, boiled in water. Meat dumplings (called Klopse or Kl\u00f6pse in north-eastern Germany, Kn\u00f6pfle and Nocken in southern Germany) contain meat or liver. Liver dumplings are frequent additions to soup. Th\u00fcringer Kl\u00f6\u00dfe are made from raw or boiled potatoes, or a mixture of both, and are often filled with croutons. Bread dumplings are made with white bread and are sometimes shaped like a loaf of bread, and boiled in a napkin, in which case they are known as napkin dumplings (Serviettenkn\u00f6del). Potato dumplings, known as Kartoffelkl\u00f6\u00dfe, are common in Bavaria, Thuringia, and the Rhineland areas, but they are also consumed all over the country.[32] They generally consist of a combination of cooked and raw potatoes that are cooked in a salted water or pan-seared in butter. A Thuringian type of potato dumplings called Th\u00fcringer Kl\u00f6\u00dfe, is made with potatoes and bread and is a common variation of potato dumplings. Kartoffelkl\u00f6\u00dfe are often served alongside roasted and braised meats, sauerbraten and sauerkraut, goulash and rouladen",

        "text": "In Nepal, steamed dumplings known as momo (or momo-cha) are a popular snack, often eaten as a full meal as well. They are similar to the Chinese jiaozi or the Central Asian manti. This dish is native to Tibet and the concept of the dumpling was brought to Nepal by the Newar traders of Kathmandu who were trading goods with Tibet before the 1930s. Many different fillings, both meat based and vegetarian are common. Kathmandu Valley, a popular destination for momo, has with time developed its own essence for this food that differentiates it from its Tibetan counterpart.",
